        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undeclared</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a student who currently studies at University California, Riverside. I am now undeclared, but I decide to study Theater and Film Production in the future. I grew up in Beijing, China, but I live in California now. I took my middle school and high school in Irvine, California. I do not have much work experience because I do not have enough time. Last Summer, I had an internship at "Vogue" magazine for a month and a half. I learned a lot because I had many opportunities to work with some celebrities, like some simple magazine cover shots.  
I love the job of designing, so I chose to do an internship at Vogue magazine in Beijing, China. Besides, I especially love film production and animation, so I love watching movies. In my spare time, I like sports and singing. Playing badminton and jogging has become my daily life. Also, I love Xtreme sports, like Bungee jumping and sky-diving. 
I volunteer during weekends with my friend, like Walk MS, Walk Arthritis, Walk to end Alzheimer's, Food Bank, Beach cleaner, and Senior Center. I enjoyed serving food elderly in the senior center. 
In my spare time, I like to visit various museums. I had visited The Broad, LA County Museum of Art, The Getty Center, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. These are great places to visit during the weekend. Furthermore, I love reading science fiction, and novels, like The Hunger Games.    
Traveling around the world also becomes my dream. I like to experience every country's culture and convention. I am a foodie because I love eating cuisines from every country. Besides Chinese food, I especially like Japanese food because it is healthy and delicious. Sushi and Ramen are my favorite.       
When I was in high school, I was one of the members of the choir. As a choral delegation, we were invited by the Italian embassy to perform in Italy and Rome. In high school, I got three years of the academic high honor roll and became a literacy star every semester. I joined in school's band in high school. I am a guitar player and vocal in my band. I also became a member of the Tutoring club in my high school. After class, I will tutor two students in the field of Biology. I felt that it was a huge honor to be in the Tutoring Club.   
I have some long term and short term goals. My short-term goal is to complete my college degree. My long term goal is to apply for an internship in Hollywood because I want to be a director, so Hollywood is the right place for me to start. I want to use my ability to direct more and more great and impressive films. 
In my daily life, I think that I have a clear organization toward work and assignments. I will do my work in advance. Sometimes, I am not patient during work. However, I will try to improve myself step by step.       
Here are my email and my contact information.
